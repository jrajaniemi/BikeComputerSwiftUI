We are excited to introduce a new feature in the Bike App Computer: battery consumption control! Now you can directly adjust battery usage from the settings. With the new battery threshold slider, ranging from 40-100%, you have full control over your device’s performance. When your battery level is above the threshold or your device is charging, GPS updates will be frequent and precise, ensuring optimal location accuracy and route tracking. If the battery level falls below your set threshold, the app will automatically reduce update frequency and accuracy to conserve battery life. This innovative feature allows you to balance location precision and battery longevity, ensuring your app performs exactly as you need it to during your rides. Optimize your experience with the new battery management settings today!


## Fonts

The Univers® typeface family is one of the most prolific grotesque sans-serif typefaces of the century. Like Helvetica®, Univers is based on 1898‘s Akzidenz-Grotesk. However, Univers is unique in that the design lacks superfluous features of any type, creating a design that is versatile and distinctive without being obstrusive. Adrian Frutiger began work on Univers in 1954, completing his design in 1957. The Univers type family has grown to 44 different weights and styles, some of which include Cyrillic characters.
