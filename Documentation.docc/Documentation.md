Support for the British Imperial System

We have added full support for the British Imperial System. Now you can view your cycling stats in miles per hours, miles, and feets, providing greater flexibility and convenience for our users in regions that use these units.

Enhanced Odometer Display

We've increased the space allocated for the odometer reading and updated it to a larger font size. This enhancement ensures that you can easily read your distance traveled at a glance, even while on the move.

New and Improved Font

Introducing the Barlow font! We've updated the app with a new, more readable font to improve your overall user experience. The Barlow font is clean, modern, and designed to make your on-screen text clearer and more pleasant to read.

Update now and enjoy these new features and improvements. Thank you for choosing Bike App Computer!


## What's new in version 0.1.1

We are excited to introduce a new feature in the Bike App Computer: battery consumption control! Now you can directly adjust battery usage from the settings. With the new battery threshold slider, ranging from 40-100%, you have full control over your deviceâ€™s performance. When your battery level is above the threshold or your device is charging, GPS updates will be frequent and precise, ensuring optimal location accuracy and route tracking. If the battery level falls below your set threshold, the app will automatically reduce update frequency and accuracy to conserve battery life. This innovative feature allows you to balance location precision and battery longevity, ensuring your app performs exactly as you need it to during your rides. Optimize your experience with the new battery management settings today!


## Fonts

Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast, grotesk type family. Drawing from the visual style of the California public, Barlow shares qualities with the state's car plates, highway signs, busses, and trains.

The Barlow project is led by Jeremy Tribby, a designer based in San Francisco, USA. To contribute, see github.com/jpt/barlow
